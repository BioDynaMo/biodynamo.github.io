As complex biological\nsystems typically consists of many million to hundreds of millions of cells the BioDynaMo\ncomputing core needed to be very efficient and make optimially use of the many available cores and GPU's in\ntypical modern computing hardware. For this reason BioDynaMo is also written in modern C++ to be as\nclose to the hardware as possible.\nThanks to this relentless focus on efficiency large biological systems can be simulated in acceptable times\nand BioDynaMo performs extremely well when modelling systems with less than a few million agents.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/team/"},"timeToRead":1,"excerpt":"About Us We are an international, interdisciplinary group of researchers who are passionate about using\nmodern computer simulationâ€¦","fileAbsolutePath":"/website/content/team/index.md"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/team/"}},
